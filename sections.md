Vanilla CSS: advantages & disadvantages
Advantages
- CSS code is decoupled from JSX code
- Therefore, CSS code can be written by another developer who needs minial access to JSX code
Disadvantages
- You need to know CSS
- CSS rules may clash across components

Inline Styles can prevent this broad style application, but still you need to know CSS to do this, and you have to edit them all individually
